Canvas Shape Creation - Implementation Plan
Step 1: Create accordion menu of shapes

On the left side of the users screen, I want a fixed vertical menu of available shapes
The shapes should be a Circle, a Rectangle, and a text box
You should pull from the Konva api wherever possible (I believe they all can be made)
The options should have pictures of the available shapes or options (think how draw.io has available options in the sidebar)


Step 2: Ability to add shapes to the canvas

This feature should allow users to drag one of the available options created in the above step onto the canvas
These should be of fixed size and not editable as of right now. All we want to do is have users create a fixed size object that is able to be dragged onto the screen
Go with the drag ability from the vertical bar. I want you to display a drag preview of what it would look like if the user let go and placed the shape there along with any relevant coordinate translation.
Base the shape of the objects based on 100% zoom. If we try to place an object when the current window has 80% zoom, it should be scaled accordingly. Make each object have a collection of default sizes and leave it at that
Users will not dynamically resize created shapes. That will come as a later feature
